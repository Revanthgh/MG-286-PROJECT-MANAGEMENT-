a. Conducting feasibility studies;
b. Preparing tender documents;
c. Tender advising;
d. Supervising site operations; and
e. Inspection and certification of the completed work.


On an average, the Interior Designer handles about 40 to 50 Customer Projects each year, with a total turnover of Rs. 50 million. Typically, each Project would involve at least 150 man days of work, in the above- mentioned operations. The extent of Reports to be generated would typically comprise 100 – 150 pages for each Project; in addition, an Information Database is to be created, with some 150 records of entry, each having about 10 to 12 fields.


1. Conduct a detailed systems design for the above interior designer; including the following activities:
1. Needs Analysis;                                                                                        (10 marks)
2. System Identification; ;                                                                             (10 marks)
3. Synthesis of Solutions;                                                                             (10 marks)
